**TOP 10 LIST WEEK 04**

**1. [Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/computer_memory.htm)**
<br>
A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions. Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.

**2. [Logical and Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)**
<br>
In short, Logical Address is created by CPU while a program is running a program, while Physical Adrress is the physical location of data in memory. We never directly deals with physicall address but we could access it through the corresponding logical address.

**3. [Address Binding](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-address-binding)**
<br>
Address binding allocates a physical memory location to a logical pointer by associating a physical address to a logical address, which is also known as a virtual address. Address binding is part of computer memory management and it is performed by the operating system on behalf of the applications that need access to memory.

**4. [Memory Mapping](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/overview-of-memory-mapping.html)**
<br>
Memory mapping is a mechanism that maps a portion of a file, or an entire file, on disk to a range of addresses within an application's address space.

**5. [Memory Swapping](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)**
Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory (or move) to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes.

**6. [Virtual File system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system)**
<br>
VFS is an abstract layer on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way.

**7. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)**
<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be nonâ€“contiguous.

**8. [Memory Management Unit](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management-unit-MMU)**
<br>
A memory management unit (MMU) is a computer hardware component that handles all memory and caching operations associated with the processor. The MMU is responsible for all aspects of memory management.

**9. [Fragmentation](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/fragmentation.aspx)**
<br>
In a computer storage system, as processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory space is broken into small pieces. In this way memory space used inefficiently, so the capacity or performance of the system may degrade.

**10. [Contiguous Memory allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-contiguous-and-noncontiguous-memory-allocation/)**
<br>
Contiguous memory allocation is basically a method in which a single contiguous section/part of memory is allocated to a process or file needing it. Because of this all the available memory space resides at the same place together, which means that the freely/unused available memory partitions are not distributed in a random fashion here and there across the whole memory space.
