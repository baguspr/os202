**TOP 10 LIST WEEK 05**

**1. [Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)**
<br>
A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion.To put it in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.

**2. [Main Seven States of A Process](https://www.guru99.com/process-management-pcb.html)**
<br>

* **New:** The new process is created when a specific program calls from secondary memory/ hard disk to primary memory/ RAM.

* **Ready:** In a ready state, the process should be loaded into the primary memory, which is ready for execution.

* **Waiting:** The process is waiting for the allocation of CPU time and other resources for execution.

* **Executing:** The process is an execution state.

* **Blocked:** It is a time interval when a process is waiting for an event like I/O operations to complete.

* **Suspended:** Suspended state defines the time when a process is ready for execution but has not been placed in the ready queue by OS.
* **Terminated:** Terminated state specifies the time when a process is terminated

**3. [Process Control Block](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-process-control-block-pcb)**
<br>
Process Control Block is a data structure that contains information of the process related to it. The process control block is also known as a task control block, entry of the process table, etc

**4. [Process identifier](https://www.anvir.com/process-identifier.htm)**
<br>
Process identifier (PID) is a number used by some operating system kernels (such as that of UNIX, Mac OS X or Windows NT) to uniquely identify a process.

**5. [fork()](https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html)**
<br>
System call fork() is used to create processes. It takes no arguments and returns a process ID. The purpose of fork() is to create a new process, which becomes the child process of the caller. After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call.

### We can differentiate the parent from the child by testing the returned value of fork():

* **Negative:** the creation of a child process was unsuccessful.

* **Zero:** returns a zero to the newly created child process

* **Positive:** returns the process ID of the child process, to the parent.

**6. [Sleep](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1719071/how-is-sleep-implemented-at-the-os-level)**
<br>
Sleep() is implemented at the OS level. The processor doesn't spin when a task/thread/process is sleeping. That particular thread is put on a pending queue (the thread isn't ready to run) until the time has expired at which point the thread will be placed on the ready to run queue.

**7. [execlp](http://www.it.uu.se/education/course/homepage/os/vt18/module-2/exec/)**
<br>
The execlp system call duplicates the actions of the shell in searching for an executable file if the specified file name does not contain a slash (/) character. The search path is the path specified in the environment by the PATH variable. If this variable isnâ€™t specified, the default path ":/bin:/usr/bin" is used.

**8. [Thread](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_multi_threading.htm)**
<br>
A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.

**9. [Pthread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15127279/whats-a-pthread)**
<br>
Pthreads are defined as a set of C language programming types and procedure calls, implemented with a pthread.h header/include file and a thread library - though this library may be part of another library, such as libc, in some implementations.

**10. [Concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)**
<br>
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel.
