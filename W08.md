**TOP 10 LIST WEEK 08**

**1. [Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)**
<br>
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.
<br>
Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.

**2. [Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)**
<br>
Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. The resources (mainly CPU cycles) are allocated to the process for the limited amount of time and then is taken away, and the process is again placed back in the ready queue if that process still has CPU burst time remaining.

**3. [Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)**
<br>
In this type of scheduling method, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. The process that keeps the CPU busy will release the CPU either by switching context or terminating. It is the only method that can be used for various hardware platforms. That's because it doesn't need specialized hardware (ex: a timer) like preemptive Scheduling.

**4. [CPU Burst](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst/answer/Arghyadeep-Sarkar-5?ch=10&share=9c25fc06&srid=uxGcii)**
<br>
It is the amount of time required by a process or can be said the amount of time required by the process to finish. We can not estimate the time taken by the process before running it. So most of the problem is related to the burst time.

<br>

*Burst Time= Turn around Time(Completion Time)-Waiting Time*

**5. [FCFS Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)**
<br>
First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve. 

**6. [SJF Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)**
<br>
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First. 

**7. [RR Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)**
<br>
Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm. Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum. Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period. Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.

**8. [Thread Scheduling](http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/qnxcar2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.qnx.doc.neutrino.sys_arch%2Ftopic%2Fkernel_SCHEDULING.html)**
<br>
The execution of a running thread is temporarily suspended whenever the microkernel is entered as the result of a kernel call, exception, or hardware interrupt. A scheduling decision is made whenever the execution state of any thread changesâ€”it doesn't matter which processes the threads might reside within. Threads are scheduled globally across all processes. 

**9. [NUMA](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access)**
<br>
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded. NUMA is used in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system.

**10. [Big O Notation](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)**
<br>
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
