TOP 10 LIST WEEK 02

**1. Security Violations**
<br>
Security violations can be categorized as intentional or accidental. The term intruder, hacker, and attacker are used for those who attempted to breach security.

### Types of violations:
* Breach of integrity:
	Unauthorized modification of data.

* Breach of availability:
	Unauthorized destruction of data.

* Theft of service:
	Unauthorized use of resources.

* Denial of service (DOS):
	Preventing legitimate use of the system.

**2. Program Threats**
<br>
Attackers usually creates a program that could breach security since it is their common goal.

### Common methods that could cause security breaches by programs:
* Malware:
	A software that is designed to exploit, disable, or damage computer systems.

* Code Injection:
	Usually, a software is not dangerous, but it could be malicious to security due to a code-injection attack where executable code is added or modified.

* Viruses and Worms:
	A fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program. Think of it like *virus in our body*, they are *self-replicating* and are created to "infect" other organs, in this case, programs. They are usually transmitted via spam e-mail or downloadable program.
	Different than viruses, **worms** only use a network to replicate *without* any help from humans.

**3. [Cryptography](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/cryptography)**
<br>
Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

**4. [User Authentication](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/user-authentication)**
<br>
User authentication is the verification of an active human-to-machine transfer of credentials required for confirmation of a user’s authenticity.

### Types of user authentication:

* Passwords:
    Extremely common, easy to use, but can often be guessed, exposed, or illegally transferred to unauthorized user. To avoid password sniffing, a system can use One-Time Passwords (OTP) that is valid only for only one login session.

* [Biometrics :](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-iot-biometrics-how-do-they-work-are-they-safe.html)
	A way to measure a person’s physical characteristics to verify their identity.

**5. [Code Signing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms537361(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)**
<br>
Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authenticity and integrity.

**6. [Firewalls](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aoru)**
<br>
A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Firewalls prevent unauthorized internet users from accessing private networks connected to the internet, especially intranets.

**7. [Sandboxing](https://techterms.com/definition/sandboxing)**
<br>
Sandboxing is a software management strategy that isolates applications from critical system resources and other programs. It provides an extra layer of security that prevents malware or harmful applications from negatively affecting your system.

**8. [Access Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/)**
<br>
A security model of protection state in computer system. It is represented as a matrix. Access matrix is used to define the rights of each process executing in the domain with respect to each object. The rows of matrix represent domains and columns represent objects.

**9. [Protection Rings](https://en.bmstu.wiki/Protection_ring_(Operating_Systems))**
<br>
Protection rings are mechanisms to protect data and functionality from faults (by improving fault tolerance) and malicious behaviour (by providing computer security). This approach is diametrically opposite to that of capability-based security

**10. [System-Call Filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_system_call_filter_check.html)**
<br>
System call filters are installed to prevent the ability to execute system calls related to forking as a defense mechanism against arbitrary code execution attacks on Elasticsearch. The system call filter check ensures that if system call filters are enabled, then they were successfully installed.
